\chapter{Summary}\label{chap:summary}
As data has been collected and empirically analysed by the canteen personal, found that researchers and students are lazy and will not bring their used service back to the canteen for cleaning. To accommodate this problem a robot is being designed which is able to collect "forgotten" cups and while performing this task also sweeps the floors. The robot platform has been developed but algorithms for the motion planning is still needed. This summary will give an overview of the software design for the robot.
